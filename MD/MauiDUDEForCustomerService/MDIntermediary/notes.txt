This project is used to code functionality into the existing MauiDUDEForCustomerService without having to resort to VB.NET.
This is necessary because MD references MauiDUDEForCustomerService, not the other way around.
As pieces of MauiDUDEForCustomerService are absorbed into the MD project, so should any relevant code within this project (MdIntermediary).
