(RETIRED) Unauthorized Institution Record Updates QC

This report will be used to select all lender and owner records where an update was made by a user not authorized to make these changes.  Due to a procedural need to give staff access to a screen where these changes may be made, we need to monitor that it is not done inadvertently.
