Late Stage Special Campaign - FED

This SAS will mirror the format of the "Delinquency Management Special Calling Campaign - CornerStone" in order to function with the Noble dialer. It will also differ in that it will target individuals in the late stage (> 180 day delinquency) that are tracked for quarterly metrics reviews.
