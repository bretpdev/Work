Military Deferment Reveiw -FED

This SAS will have one file that will identify borrowers who have a Military Deferment on their account for more than 12 months. It will feed into Q Builder and create a task to review the active duty status on the DOD website. The other file will be borrowers in Miitary Deferment whose IDR plan PFH payment is about to expire. Due to the HEROES Act we need to maintain the same PFH payment for the borrower for up to 3 years. This will also feed into Q Builder to create a review task to re-apply the IDR payment as applicable.
