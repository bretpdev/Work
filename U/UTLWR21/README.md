This report will identify borrowers who want their payments (borr, military) applied a special way. Previously, CS would submit a payment adjustment each month through Need Help for Financial Services to process. Now, we will be marking these accounts with a flagging ARC.  

This report will identify payments received for the previous day for all borrowers who have a special payment adjustment ARC and insert them into ArcAddProcessing to create a task for Financial Services to reapply the payments according to the borrowerâ€™s specifications.
