<h3>Details of the Plan</h3>
<p>
	This is the plan all loans are set up on initially. On the Standard or Level Repayment
	plan, you pay the same amount for each installment payment throughout the entire
	repayment period. However, events like deferment or forbearance may cause changes
	to the monthly installment amount. This option is usually the fastest and most economical
	method of repayment.
