<h3>Details of the Plan</h3>
<p>
	You can qualify for this plan if you have more than $30,000 in outstanding FFELP
	or Direct loans and your loans were first disbursed on or after 10/7/1998. This
	option is ideal if you need a lower payment because under this plan your payment
	will be determined by an extended repayment term. Your repayment term will be determined
	by the date your loan was disbursed and the type of loan.
