<h3>Details of the Plan</h3>
<p>
	Under Income-Based Repayment (IBR), your monthly payment is calculated based on
	your income and family size. It is meant to help make your student loan payments
	more affordable.
</p>

<h3>Loan Types</h3>
<h4><strong>Direct Loans</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Stafford Subsidized</li>
	<li>Stafford Unsubsidized</li>
	<li>Consolidation</li>
	<li>Graduate PLUS</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payments</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		In order to qualify for IBR, you must be experiencing a partial financial hardship.
		A partial financial hardship means that the annual payments on a Standard Repayment
		plan exceed 15% of the difference between your AGI and 150% of the poverty level
		for your state and family size.
	</li>
	<li>
		Your payment is calculated by taking 15% of the difference between your adjusted
		gross income (AGI) and 1.5 times the poverty level for your state and family size.
		If your calculated monthly payment is less than your payment would be on a standard
		repayment plan, you qualify for IBR.
	</li>
	<li>
		If your calculated payment is less than $5, your payment will be $0. If your calculated
		monthly payment is greater than $5 and less than $10, your payment will be $10.
		If your calculated monthly payment is more than $10, your monthly payment will be
		the calculated amount.
	</li>
	<li>
		You must reapply each year and your monthly payment amount may be adjusted based
		on changes to your income, family size or the poverty level for your state.
	</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Repayment Terms</h3>
<p>
	The maximum repayment term is 25 years. If your loans are not repaid after 25 years,
	the remaining balance will be forgiven.

<h3>Other Information</h3>
<p>
	If the calculated payment is less than the interest that accrues each month on subsidized
	loans or the subsidized portion of a Consolidation loan, you will not be charged
	the unpaid interest on those loans for three years from when you begin repayment
	under the IBR plan, excluding periods of Economic Hardship Deferment.
