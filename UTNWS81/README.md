Identifying Active Duty Military Borrowers--FED

(see table CLS.scra.ActiveDutyValidation)

FSA has requested we identify all active duty military borrowers. This SAS will pull all borrowers in the federal region and the output will be formatted to interact with the Dept of Defense active duty military database. The Dept of Defense return file will interact with various scripts to identify active duty military borrowers and conduct outreach to those borrowers.
