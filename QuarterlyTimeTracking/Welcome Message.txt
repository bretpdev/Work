Welcome to your new role at UHEAA.  Please begin tracking your time from your effective start date using the spreadsheet located at:

Q:\Support Services\Time tracking\<folder with your full name>\<excel template with your full name>

The general guideline calls for tracking your time approximated to 15 minutes (entered in the Hours column). If you worked on something other than what’s listed in columns C-G & J-L, then write it under the Generic Meetings column.  Be sure to choose a Cost Center when applicable; your supervisor can let you know which to choose if in doubt.  Time devoted to NeedHelp tickets should not be tracked within the spreadsheet since a separate system tracks those hours. Also, please list your vacation & sick hours when taken; all hours should add up to at least 40 hours per week.  

Here are two time-tracking tools that can help you fill in your timesheet if you’ve worked on NeedHelp tickets:

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
