TCPA Mobile Phone Numbers that have Consent before April 1st, 2012

The purpose of this report is to find all customer service borrowers who have consent on their cell phones prior to April 1st, 2012 and all claim paid borrowers who have consent on their cell phones prior to June August 3rd, 2012.  The correct dialogue to ask account holders if we have their permission to contact them using an automated dialer was implemented on these dates in their respected call centers.
