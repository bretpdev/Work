Historical Active Duty Reporting - UHEAA

A script is needed to identify current and historical military borrowers as well as accurately determine their corresponding active duty periods. In order to accomplish this, the script will grab archived DOD return files and load them into historical active duty SQL tables. Loading this information this will allow for the military data to be queried for compliance use.

This request is being submitted to assist with UNH 68829.
