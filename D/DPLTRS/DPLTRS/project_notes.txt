The script is part of a transition for the Loan Management Letters "script" from VBA to C#.
The original VBA code can be found in the Loan Management session code.
Each new letter should be written as it's own class inheriting from scriptbase, until all letters have been converted.
Once all have been converted, the architecture of this project should be re-assessed.
